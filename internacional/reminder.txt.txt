Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow

I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go Lo Mein (Lo Mein, Lo Mein)

You know me (you know me, you know)
You know, man (you know, man, you know, man)
You know me (you know me, you know me)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (you know me, you know me)
Pow! Pow! You know me (you know me, know me)

Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause you know me

You know me (you know me, you know)
You know, man (you know, man, you know, man)
You know me (you know me, you know me)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (you know me, you know me)
Pow! Pow! You know me (you know me, know me)

Why don't you shake some, shake somethin' for the Don?
Don't you break nothin', break nothin', baby girl
Won't you work some, work somethin' for the Don?
Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin', big girl
Won't you shake some, shake somethin' for the Don?
Don't you break nothin', break nothin', baby girl
Won't you work some, work somethin' for the Don?
Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

'Cause you know me, they know me
You ain't know me, yet you know me
